# Documentation

## Purpose
This folder contains all project documentation required to understand
the system from a business and technical perspective.

## What will be added here
- Business requirements (HR & payroll use cases)
- System architecture diagrams
- API flow documentation
- Database design explanations
- SaaS assumptions & constraints

## Why this matters
In real SaaS projects, documentation is created before and alongside
development to align engineering, QA, and business teams.
